## AI/ML Resources that I Found Helpful
### Compiled by Clay Morton

Start [here](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-large-language-models-work-91c362f5b78f)
to learn about the basics of AI and Machine learning. This gives a nice 
foundation and vocabulary for the following resources. [Here](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks) is an IBM 
explanation that tells the differences between all the terms mentioned in the
previous article.

Note that I view all of the different 'types' of AI as tiers because AI is
really a blanket term, but the world tends to group things into 'AI' in general.
This document puts the tiers in order of complexity and intelligence/connections
as I see them.

# Tiers of 'AI'

## Tier 1: Artificial Intelligence
